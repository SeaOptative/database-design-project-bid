# database-design-project-bid

This project involves creating a database using SQL for a fictional company that is growing and will like to transition from the paper style record keeping into keeping records in a database. I created a database that allows the business keep track of customers, orders, payments. The data base made it easy to track business inventory and help business run reports easier to see trends. Creating the database from scratch included defining busoness rules, creating an entity relationship diagram, primary key and integrity rules. C++ was then utilized for user input and populate database.
